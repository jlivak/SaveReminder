# Free Save Reminder

Save Reminder is a free program for Windows created by someone who was fed up with losing hours of work from forgetting to save while working in Maya. 

You can configure this program to remind you every (x) minutes whenever it detects a specific program or programs are running.  You can also configure it to run at startup so that after your initial setup it will continuously run in the background.

## Downloading and Installation

You can find the most recent release on the Releases page.

Extract the folder to wherever you want the program to live (for ex. 'C:/Program Files/Save Reminder') and then run SaveReminder.exe and follow the directions at the top.  *You may need to run this as an administrator to enable Run at Startup.

You can temporarily pause reminders or return to the configuration utility by right clicking on the Save Reminder icon (white floppy disk) in your taskbar while the reminder service is running.
